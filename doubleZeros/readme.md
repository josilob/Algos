# doubleZeros

Given a fixed length array `arr` of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are removed.

Do the above modifications to the input array in place, *do not* return anything from your function.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: Input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: Input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return arr
 */
 
const duplicateZeros = function(arr) {

}
```
