# Stacks

Stacks as data structure are very similar to queues.
Biggest difference would be that data is organized as the name says, in stacks (think of as on top of each other)

Sequence, or order of the elements entering the stack directly affect the sequence they will be leaving. Here's the biggest difference.

Stacks as data structures can be
FILO (First-In-Last-Out) ... or Last record in is the first record out.

In order to add records to stacks, we would depend on two array methods. Push and pop, unline unshift that we used in queues.

Insert operation is called push operation.
Delete operation is called pop operation.
