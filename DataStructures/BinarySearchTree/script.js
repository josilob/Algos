// Binary Search Tree
// Every node can have at most 2 children positioned relative to the parent
// One node is to the left, the other is to the right of a parent
// Values and position are tightly connected
// Left element is less than parent node, while the node to the right is greater than parent

// Parent Node => left_node(value>left.value) && right_node(value<right.value)
