 * == Perfect Number ==
 * In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of
 * its positive divisors(factors), excluding the number itself.
 * For example: 6 ==> divisors[1, 2, 3, 6]
 *      Excluding 6, the sum(divisors) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
 *      So, 6 is a Perfect Number
 * Other examples of Perfect Numbers: 28, 486, ...
