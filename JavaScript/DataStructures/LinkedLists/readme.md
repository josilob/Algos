## Linked Lists

Linked list is an ordered collection of data. The collection contains a number of different nodes.
Those nodes form chain whose order is always maintained.
So, in other words it means that sequence of nodes in a linked list won't suddenly/randomly change unles we speciifically want to do so.

Every linked list has two special nodes (Head node - very first node, and Tail node - very last one)
Tail node can be identified by the face that it does not have a reference to any other node.
