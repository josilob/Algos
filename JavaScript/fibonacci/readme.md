## Fibonacci

Print out the n-th entry in the fibonacci series.
The fibonacci series ins an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.
For example, the sequence:
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
forms the first ten entries of the fibonacci series.

Remember: For 5th element we look at index 5 instead of 4, because 0 does not add any value, so we start actually from 1. 0 is there 'hardcoded' without value.

```js
// Example:
fib(4) === 3;
```
