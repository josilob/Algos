# dnaStrings ðŸ§¬

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as are "C" and "G". Write a function called dnaTransform that takes in a DNA string and returns a string that represents it's compliment.

```js
/**
 * @param {str} // a string of DNA
 * @return {str} // a string of the DNA's counterpart
 */

// INPUT:
// "ATTGC"

// OUTPUT:
// => "TAACG"

let dnaStrings = (str) => {
	return dna;
};
```

## Notes for the hackers ðŸ‘‰

```js
// what do we know?
// each letter in a DNA string has only one counterpart.
// A <- -> T
// G <- -> C

// input is a string
// if we're going to check each letter in the string we'll have to make an array

// output is required to be a string

// resiting the problem:
// this function will take in a string of "RNA", we will have to check each letter and return a string with the corresponding "RNA"
```
