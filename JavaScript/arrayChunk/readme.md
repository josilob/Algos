# arrayChunk

Given an array and the chunk size, divide the array into many where each subarray is of the chunk's size.

-- Examples --

chunk([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],3) => [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7]]
chunk([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],4) => [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9]]
chunk([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],10) => [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]]
