# pyramid_sum_ruby

Write a method `pyramid_sum` that takes in an array of numbers representing the base of a pyramid. The function should return a 2D array representing a complete pyramid with the given base. To construct a level of the pyramid, we take the sum of adjacent elements of the level below.

```ruby
# For example, the base [1, 4, 6] gives us the following pyramid
#     15
#   5   10
# 1   4    6
```

```ruby
# @param [nums]
# @return [[nums]]

def pyramid_sum(base)
  # Happy Hacking!
end

p pyramid_sum([1, 4, 6]) #=> [[15], [5, 10], [1, 4, 6]]


p pyramid_sum([3, 7, 2, 11]) #=> [[41], [19, 22], [10, 9, 13], [3, 7, 2, 11]]
```
