# cesar_cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus `'A' ↔ 'N'`, `'B' ↔ 'O'` and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

```ruby
# INPUT: rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC")
# OUTPUT: "FREE CODE CAMP"
```

```ruby
# INPUT: rot13("SERR CVMMN!")
# OUTPUT: "FREE PIZZA!"
```

```ruby
# @param string
# @return string

def rot13(string)
  # happy hacking!
end
